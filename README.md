# CATCH THE LIZ

**Catch the Liz** is a fun and interactive web-based game that challenges players to test their reflexes and observation skills by catching elusive lizards (Liz). The game features a grid of tiles, each displaying either adorable cats, playful dogs, or the mischievous Liz, and players must swiftly identify and "catch" the Liz while avoiding any false clicks on innocent animals.

## Main Features

- **Grid-Based Gameplay**: The game is presented in a grid layout, with each tile containing an image of a cat, a dog, or the Liz. Players must quickly click on the Liz tiles while avoiding other animals.

- **Challenging Timer**: Players are given a limited amount of time to catch as many Liz tiles as possible. The countdown timer adds a sense of urgency to the gameplay, making it both thrilling and engaging.

- **Randomized Tile Placement**: The position of the Liz tiles changes with each round, ensuring that the game remains dynamic and prevents memorization of the pattern.

- **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of the player's score, increasing with each successful Liz catch and decreasing for false clicks. Players aim to achieve the highest score possible within the given time.

- **Preloading Images**: To reduce image loading times and prevent flickering, the game preloads images in the background, providing smooth gameplay.
